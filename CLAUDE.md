# Development Partnership

We build production code together. I handle implementation details while you guide architecture and catch complexity early.

## Core Workflow: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate

**Start every feature with:** "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

1. **Research** - Understand existing patterns and architecture
2. **Plan** - Propose approach and verify with you
3. **Implement** - Build with tests and error handling
4. **Validate** - ALWAYS run formatters, linters, and tests after implementation

## Code Organization

**Keep functions small and focused:**
- If you need comments to explain sections, split into functions
- Group related functionality into clear packages
- Prefer many small files over few large ones

## Architecture Principles

**This is always a feature branch:**
- Delete old code completely - no deprecation needed
- No versioned names (processV2, handleNew, ClientOld)
- No migration code unless explicitly requested
- No "removed code" comments - just delete it

**Prefer explicit over implicit:**
- Clear function names over clever abstractions
- Obvious data flow over hidden magic
- Direct dependencies over service locators

## Maximize Efficiency

**Parallel operations:** Run multiple searches, reads, and greps in single messages
**Multiple agents:** Split complex tasks - one for tests, one for implementation
**Batch similar work:** Group related file edits together

## Go Development Standards

### Required Patterns
- **Concrete types** not interface{} or any - interfaces hide bugs
- **Channels** for synchronization, not time.Sleep() - sleeping is unreliable  
- **Early returns** to reduce nesting - flat code is readable code
- **Delete old code** when replacing - no versioned functions
- **fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)** - preserve error chains
- **Table tests** for complex logic - easy to add cases
- **Godoc** all exported symbols - documentation prevents misuse

## Problem Solving

**When stuck:** Stop. The simple solution is usually correct.

**When uncertain:** "Let me ultrathink about this architecture."

**When choosing:** "I see approach A (simple) vs B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"

Your redirects prevent over-engineering. When uncertain about implementation, stop and ask for guidance.

## Testing Strategy

**Match testing approach to code complexity:**
- Complex business logic: Write tests first (TDD)
- Simple CRUD operations: Write code first, then tests
- Hot paths: Add benchmarks after implementation

**Always keep security in mind:** Validate all inputs, use crypto/rand for randomness, use prepared SQL statements.

**Performance rule:** Measure before optimizing. No guessing.

## Progress Tracking

- **TodoWrite** for task management
- **Clear naming** in all code

Focus on maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.

## Original Prompt
no matter where our progress is, the 'claude code prompt.md' file was the original prompt which documented my desired end goal.

## Current Progress
Always work/edit on the ipynb file without creating different notebooks just for code updates. Keep the plan.md file updated to the latest plan and progress. 

## Check Knowledge
The file "合併文章總集" contains official documentation on the use of relevant APIs. Refer to this file at first or when we're stuck to ensure we're adopting the latest practice. f
